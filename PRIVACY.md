# Privacy Policy

Photos Cleanup Assistant is designed with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

**What we access:**
- Photo thumbnails visible on screen (to identify selection targets)
- Date information displayed in the Google Photos UI

**What we store locally:**
- Batch metadata (name, date range, count)
- User preferences (selection speed settings)

**What we NEVER collect:**
- Full-resolution photos
- Photo content or image data
- Google account credentials
- Browsing history outside photos.google.com

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API. No data leaves your device.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all extension data at any time:
1. Right-click the extension icon → "Options"
2. Click "Clear All Data"

Or uninstall the extension, which removes all stored data.

## Permissions
